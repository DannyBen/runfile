# this example shows how to add actions without a preceding command.
# the global action will be called only if:
# 1. the executed command matches the usage pattern 
# 2. AND it does not match any other command in the file

# Just so we can 'say' with colors
require 'colsole'
include Colsole

usage  "FILE USER [--color]"
help   "This is an action without a command"
option "--color", "Use color"
action :global do |args|
  color = args['--color'] ? '!txtgrn!' : ""
  say "#{color}This is a global action with file=#{args['FILE']} and user=#{args['USER']}"
end

# this is a "regular" action. although the command 'run copy file'
# may also match the global pattern 'run FILE USER', this action
# will take precedence over the global action.
usage  "copy FILE"
help   "This is an action with a 'copy' command"
action :copy do
  say "When I say COPY you say PASTE."
  say "COPY ..."
