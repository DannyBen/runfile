# this example shows how to add positional params to the generated help text.
# note that this is only used in the generated help, and has no other purpose.
# as with docopt, you can use either the <param> or PARAM syntax.
# 
# run 'run -h' to see how it works

usage  "connect HOST PORT"
param  "HOST", "Host to connect to"
param  "PORT", "Port to connect to"
action :connect do |args|
  puts "Connecting #{args['HOST']}:#{args['PORT']}"
end

# specifying a third parameter to the `param` command, will add it under a 
# different caption

usage  "ssh USER PASS"
param  "USER", "SSH user", "SSH Parameters"
param  "PASS", "SSH password", "SSH Parameters"
action :ssh do |args|
  puts "Connecting as #{args['USER']}:#{args['PASS']}"
end
