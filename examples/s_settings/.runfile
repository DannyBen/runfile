# Runfile settings YAML

# Define the folder where *.runfile files reside
folder: commands

# Optional: File to load before any runfile
# Consider this your "helper" file.
helper: helper.rb

# Optional: Message to show before the list of files
# This string supports color markers
intro: "!txtgrn!My Command Line"

# Optional: An array of shortcut commands
# Each of the keys here will be expanded to their values before Runfile
# tries to move on to the execution stage. In other words, if you have
# a shortcut saying "s: server --daemon", and you run "run s" it is
# exactly like you run "run server --daemon".
shortcuts:
  s: server start
  sd: server start --daemon
  stat: server status
