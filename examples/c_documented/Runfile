#---

#---
# each action must have an action block.
# if the action requires arguments, it also must have a 'usage' block.
# in addition, you may use the 'help' command, which descibes the 
# action and zero or more 'option' commands that set the format and 
# help text of option flags.
#---

# usage sets the one line usage pattern of this command.
# optional for commands without any arguments.
usage "greet <name> [--long --color]"

# help sets the short description of this command.
# longer lines will be automatically wrapped based on the width of 
# the terminal.
help "Say hello to <name>. Use --long to show a longer greeting, and this line is long on purpose to see how it is displayed."

# option sets the help text of --flags.
# the command accepts two parameters: the flag syntax and the help 
# text.
option "--long", "Show a longer greeting"
option "-c --color", "Use colored output"

# action block defines what to do when this command is called
# the :symbol name should match the first string defined in the usage
# command. 
# the block recieves a single argument 'args' which includes all the
# arguments passed from the command line.
# you do not need to worry about parameters that do not exist - docopt
# already takes care of this (through our 'usage' patterns).
action :greet do |args|

	if args['--long'] 
		say "#{color}Hello #{args['<name>']}, welcome back"
