# create actions dynamically

# example 1: each action will have its own usage line

command "watch"

actions = [:css, :js, :'a-movie', :'friends-again']

actions.each do |act|
	help "Watch files of type #{act}"
	action act do 
		say act.to_s
	end
end


# example 2: use compact actions by setting usage to false
# to all but the first action

command "git"

actions    = [:commit, :push, :pull, :branch, :log]
usage_text = "( #{actions.join ' | '} )"
help "Execute a git command"

actions.each do |act|
	usage usage_text 
	usage_text = false
	action act do 
		say "git #{act}"
	end
end
