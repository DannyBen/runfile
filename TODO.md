Todo
====

- [x] Change deep scan behavior to support symlinks (`~/runfile/**{,/*/**}/*.runfile`)
- [x] Disable subdir scan in current folder (leave only in `~/runfile` and `/etc/runfile`)
- [x] If version is not set in the Runfile, don't show it instead of showing 0.0.0
- [ ] Consider adding support for `~/.runfilerc` and `/etc/.runfile` configs
- [ ] Consider allowing `call` to pass args
